       "'P.S. 15 is an extraordinary small school that goes to extraordinary lengths to engage and care for their children. The principal, Irene Sanchez, leads an incredible group of attentive teachers and administrators who are dedicated to providing a safe, caring, and exciting environment for children to learn. The G&T program is enrichment based (not \"accelerated\") and has re-instilled a sheer joy of learning in our child, which is a priority for us as a family. Of the many enrichments, the kids have a dedicated STEAM teacher, dedicated Science teacher, special interest classes that the children choose every Friday, a wonderful music class, and 2nd graders attend swimming once a week at Asphalt Green. There are also many field trips and hands on, project-based learning opportunities. The children have an amazing playground attached to the school and are allowed to play outside before and after school and during recess. They also have a great gym and have gym class three times a week. The small class sizes (our son currently has 16 children in his G&T class) is another amazing thing about this school and something that is hard to find in the NYC public school system. Another aspect I appreciate so much at PS15 is how open the lines of communication are. The teachers, staff and principal always make time to address any concerns. There is also a parent coordinator, Lanette Murphy (Ms. Mia), who will literally move mountains to address any issues you or your child might be having, whether they be logistical or more complex in nature. Most importantly, this is a school that puts an enormous amount of effort into teaching social emotional skills and into supporting their community of parents and children. They teach, by example, what it means to be curious, kind, generous, patient, tolerant and supportive. We have learned so much from P.S. 15 and feel privileged to be a part of such a special school.\\nA Hidden Gem!Amazing community school that feels like an extension to my family.
